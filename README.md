# battle


This is a basic REG  game model for fun written in python. The game is completely text based. 
The game was developed in two phases where first I focused on inventory and magic build up and in second phase I focused on attacks. 
The complete phase has an AI which will have capability to attack player that is you and the attack will be randomised.

Inspired by the works of @nickgermaines
